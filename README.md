# Loan Calculator

Hi! I've left some basic setup info here, in case it's required. Further notes on the project have either been listed at the bottom of this file, or through the project, just to add some context to decisions.

## Node Version

This project is using node version v22.11.0

Please install this, or run (to automatically use the version defined):

    nvm use

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, run these two commands in order:

    npm install
    npm start

To run the tests, run:

    npm test

## Notes

Some libraries/frameworks used:

- React
- Vite
- Vitest
- Testing Library
- Material UI - I chose this as it is well documented, quick to prototype with and is well battle-tested for UI concerns. It
  also looks clean.
- Formik - Form library I'm used to. Not strictly necessary, but again just faster for prototyping
